# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a GUI application that uses the tkinter framework to allow the user to generate a random array of varying size and select a sorting algorithm to visalize how the array is sorted.

## Motivation

I wanted to refine my knowledge of sorting algorithms and create an application that implements a range of different sorting algorithms and visualize how they opperate.


## Features

The application currents offers visualization for Bubble Sort, QuickSort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort. You are able to use the slider at the top of the application to change the size of the array which will also change the speed the array is sorted at.

The application is granted for commercial use, modifcations, distribution, and private use under the MIT License.
